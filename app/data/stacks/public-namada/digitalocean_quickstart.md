# Quick guide - Digital Ocean fullnode
This is guide for deploying a Namada full node, on either of the two Namada testnets: 1) Heliax (founding team) testnet or 2) Luminara (community-run) testnet. The installation time depends on your server specs, ranging from 1 to 2 hours

## 1. Create a new droplet (aka instance) on [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com).
After you have a DigitalOcean account, create a droplet. If you're only planning to use the droplet for a couple of days, use a more powerful (and more expensive option). If you're planning to keep it running for a weeks/months, use a more cost-effective option and monitor resource consumption.

Basic shared CPU options:
- **Intel 8gb RAM, 2 CPUs, 160gb SSD storage** - Lowest cost
  - building Namada takes ~1hr 05mins
  - storage may fill up if the chain has been long-running, use DigitalOcean to monitor/alert storage & memory
- **Intel 16gb RAM, 4 CPUs, 320gb SSD storage** - Recommended
  - building Namada takes ~50mins
  - storage may fill up if the chain has been long-running, use DigitalOcean to monitor/alert storage
- **Intel 16gb RAM, 8 CPUs, 480gb SSD storage** - Recommended
  - building Namada takes ~38mins
  - use DigitalOcean to monitor/alert storage

**Warning:** Do not use a droplet with 4 CPUs unless you have at least 16gb RAM, or compiling will fail.

a) If you're new and trying stuff out, use a password instead of SSH key (warning: for testing only; not a secure way to operate in production).

b) Get the IP address for your droplet.

c) Remotely connect to your droplet with Terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).

Use this command: `ssh root@[ip address]`

It may take a couple of minutes after creating the droplet to be able to connect, so wait a minute and try again if the connection fails.

Then enter 'yes' and input the droplet password when asked. (FYI, in production you would use SSH keys and user accounts, not root)

## 2. Install Stack Orchestrator (~1.5 mins)
On Digital Ocean, you might see some purple pop-up dialogs whenever you update your packages (including in this script); you can just press enter to select the default options.

Click the copy button (it's the icon with two overlapping squares on the right): 
```
git clone https://github.com/vknowable/stack-orchestrator.git
cd stack-orchestrator
scripts/namada-quick-install.sh
exit
```
You can paste and then execute this entire thing.

## 3. You'll be logged out of your droplet, so log back in to continue the setup
Use command `ssh root@[ip address]` to log back in.

## 4. Get Namada Docker image
You can build the container image as outlined in  the [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/vknowable/stack-orchestrator/blob/main/app/data/stacks/public-namada/README.md), but this takes 30mins to an hour, depending on your system specs. To make things easier, Knowable maintains a [pre-built image](https://hub.docker.com/r/spork666/namada).

**Wait!** You'll need to decide which Namada testnet you want to connect to, and determine which version of the Namada software is being used. FYI, all of the release versions can be [found here](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases).

### Heliax (founding team's) public testnet
The current version of Namada in use on the Heliax testnet can be found [here](https://namada.net/testnets). (As of writing, it's `v0.21.1`)

### Luminara (community-run) "Campfire" testnet
The current version of Namada in use on the Luminara testnet can be found [here](https://testnet.luminara.icu). (As of writing, itâ€™s `v0.21.1`)  

Once you know which version of Namada is needed, save it to a variable:
```
export NAMADA_TAG=v0.21.1
```

And run these commands to download the Namada image and rename it for use with Stack Orchestrator: 
```
docker pull spork666/namada:$NAMADA_TAG
docker image tag spork666/namada:v0.21.1 cerc/namada:local
```


## 5. Create a data directory for your node
```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/namada
```
## 6. Start your node

### Heliax
When joining the Heliax testnet, no further configuration is needed. You can simply start your node with:
```
laconic-so --stack public-namada deploy up
```

### Luminara
When joining the Luminara testnet, we'll need to include some addtional config info. Download the configuration file with:
```
curl -o ~/luminara.env https://testnet.luminara.icu/luminara.env
```

And then use a slightly different command to start your node:
```
laconic-so --stack public-namada deploy --env-file ~/luminara.env up
```
---
## 7. Access your node
Set `CONTAINER` as your node's container id
```
CONTAINER=$(docker ps -q)
```
and then get into your node's container to control your node
```
docker exec -it $CONTAINER /bin/bash
```

## 8. See node status, make queries (read the chain) and make transactions (write to the chain)
Wait a minute and then check the status of your node:
```
curl localhost:26657/status | jq .
```
You should see catching `"catching_up": true` while your node syncs, and when it has synced, catching up will be `false`. Then you can perform queries and make transactions.

You can always leave the container with the `exit` command, then get back in with:
```
CONTAINER=$(docker ps -q)
docker exec -it $CONTAINER /bin/bash
```

## Switch networks, shut down or delete your node
to-do: [instructions for switching between testnets]
```
laconic-so --stack public-namada deploy down --delete-volumes
```
and optionally delete all chain data
```
rm -rf ~/.local/namada
```
